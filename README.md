# Simulation-of-Video-Transmission

## Programming Language
MATLAB

## Description
This project involves creating a MATLAB simulation of a channel encoder/decoder system. Information bits, sourced from a video stream, are encoded and transmitted over a communication channel with a specified probability of error ùëù. The MATLAB code will simulate the transmission of these encoded bits, modeling the effect of the error probability on the communication process.
